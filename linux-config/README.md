# Linux Configuration Files

This directory contains configuration files that are manually created
and edited on a Linux system using the `nano` text editor.

These files are not generated automatically. They are written directly
by the user to control system behavior.

The purpose of this directory is to document and version configuration
files that exist on the local Linux system.
